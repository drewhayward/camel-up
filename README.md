# `camel-up`

A partial python implementation of the wonderful game [Camel Up](https://www.amazon.com/Eggertspiele-PBGESG50120EN-Camel-Board-Game/dp/B07HB88VXG/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=camel+up&qid=1606415483&s=toys-and-games&sr=1-1). Please buy the real game!

The program allows the movement of camels and placement of spectator tiles. It also calculates the true-probability of each camel winning the current leg.

## TODO:
- Add crazy camel execptions (always unstack, always move the laden crazy camel)
- Add crazy camels to leg simulations
- Add mid-leg odds calculations
- Create nicer CLI game display and interface
